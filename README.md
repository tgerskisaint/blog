# A chaotic, random, and highly amateurish blog

---

## I want to practice my writing in a essentially "private, but public space."
I tried to use a couple *free* blogging sites but quickly realized that they are in fact, not free, and require a subscription.
After those terrible experiences (looking at you, write.as), I figured I would just make my own using Hugo. Hopefully, this method keeps
me accountable so that I'm able to hone my craft of writing to acceptable levels.
