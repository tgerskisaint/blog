<p>I&rsquo;ve replaced VS Code with Emacs for the time being. Doom Emacs, but Emacs nonetheless. I think it&rsquo;s been a little over a year since I&rsquo;ve been on social media. Making a LinkedIn account the other day was pretty gross with the &ldquo;shorts&rdquo; and just general problematic social media structure. I sure don&rsquo;t miss Instagram. I guess I&rsquo;m still on socia media if you count Youtube. I just don&rsquo;t think I can part with it—the knowledge on there is too substantial to give up. Although I have drasticallly reduced Youtube usage on my phone and keep it mostly desktop these days. It helps that I have a FireFox plugin that heavily mods Youtube for me. I&rsquo;m always in theater mode so the only thing I can see is the video unless i click out of theater mode. Even when I do exit theater mode, everythinhg is essentially black and only where my mouse hovers is lit up. Plus I&rsquo;ve disabled shorts from my homepage and search results. So
therefore, I&rsquo;m not inlcuding Youtube in the social media group, as long as I watch healthy content and not brain-rotting garbage. Youtube is the only Alphabet company product I&rsquo;m now using, and I think I acept the trade off of the theft of hoarding of my personal information in order to use Youtube since it&rsquo;s quite possibly the largest pool of human knowledge there is—or at least it&rsquo;s certainly the easiest to digest. So far, the Proton suite has been great for me. I really don&rsquo;t have any gripes about their products worth mentioning. And, if anyone is queasy about the price for the premium subscription (which you really need), I&rsquo;d argue that it&rsquo;s much better, and morally sound, to pay for the product rather than to be the product.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently enrolled in an online cyber security course and have just completed the network security module. This is probably my weakest area of technology in general. The module helped but I still have a lot to learn. I just started <em>Computer Networking: a Top Dwn Approach</em> and i think it will be an excellent resource to cover all my inefficiencies about the internet and Networks. <em>Networking</em> maxes out my current reading material, which includes <em>Python Crash Course</em> and <em>How Computers Really Work</em>. Both of those books are great, especially with the practical applicatipons and hands-on exercises—(the most important part in learning technology). I first tried reading <em>Learning Python</em> but found it too theoretical for the phase of learning I&rsquo;m currently in. Still a great book, just have put it on the back-burner for now while I mostly enagage with material that directly help me complete the projects I am working on.</p>
