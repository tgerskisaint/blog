<p>I&rsquo;m an aggressively subpar writer, but they tell me the only way to improve that quality is to write more, and in the public eye as well, so I have some skin in the game. I guess that&rsquo;s valid advice; like a cornered weasel, I, too, can adapt and overcome when my back&rsquo;s against the wall. Of course, I&rsquo;m cheating a bit by labeling this in the public eye, but hey! Maybe someday. Now that you know about my literary skills, I can tell you some other fascinating facts about me: I&rsquo;m an entrepreneur (cringe), so yes, I am unemployed. I am proudly Ubuntu&rsquo;s newest member, which means I am now passionate about Open-Source software. I have been listening to the soundtrack of the film <em>Drive (2011)</em> for almost two weeks now; expect the occasional incoherent gem of a film review from me! I have to start exercising again because I&rsquo;m spending a mortifying amount of time in my computer chair vibe-coding, and it&rsquo;s not even a Herman Miller.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that&rsquo;s right; I was supposed to be writing a 1-page mission statement for my new business idea, while I&rsquo;m taking a break from my other startup, which has had me on the ropes all week, just mashing me with kidney shots. I will start strong again tomorrow, now that I have unlocked the blogger strength from deep within. You know what they say: the other startup idea always sounds better because it&rsquo;s painted pretty with hope, optimism, and the romancing of a new idea with new possibilities. While my current startup is drenched in gritty realism, pessimism, insane hours, and that nagging voice in the back of my mind telling me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not him! You&rsquo;re not that guy.&rdquo; Yeah, I&rsquo;m going to head out now, but before I go, let me leave you with this: drink water, read books, Future&rsquo;s 2019 EP <em>SAVE ME (2019)</em> is underrated in blasphemy proportions, and it will cure you of your woes. Likewise, Ryan Coogler&rsquo;s <em>Sinners (2025)</em> is a once-in-a-lifetime display of pure artistic genius: a film that transcends cinema and culture at large. And that&rsquo;s a wrap, folks. I bid you adieu (or however F.D.R. closed out his fireside chats).</p>
