<p><strong>Rating:</strong> ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (out of 5)</p>
<p>It’s such an artistic achievement how Coogler blended culture and history with modern-day comedy with classic horror tropes into such an astonishing masterpiece!Multi-print film was so amazing! My only gripe is that I wasn&rsquo;t able to watch it in 70 mm IMAX, but I&rsquo;ll settle for a superb IMAX viewing. The mood was menacing, it was a slow cook so you can really connect with the characters&ndash;and then boom all hell breaks loos and it hits that much more after you&rsquo;ve spent so much time marinating with the characters. The score was fantastic obviously, we wouldn&rsquo;t expect anything else from the Academy Award winning composer, Ludwig Goransson.There literally wasn&rsquo;t a bad performance but this is the year of Michael B. Jordan, folks. Also, have to shout out Delroy Lindo&ndash; he added so much humor and honesty to the film it would&rsquo;ve been an entirely different film without himMBJ ate it up with the dual role and this is by far the best I&rsquo;ve personally seen him; He&rsquo;s entering his prime and we&rsquo;re all here for it. Also, love the aspect of Smoke and Stack being veterans and going from the sharecropping Mississippi delta to seeing the other-side of he world as soldiers in WW1.  Finally, a film that showcases the true explosive talent of Michael B. Jordan.Sinners evokes so much pride in black culture and history. Coogler was able to pack so much into this film—it cohesively has it all; blood, love, violence, family, sex, community, racism, religion, and vampires.The power of family and communityThe dancing scene transcended the film to instant classic status.Black film director has taken the art of cinema and levated to such a place that he has already cemented himself om Hollywood&rsquo;s Mount Rushmore. This film is a pure triumph&ndash;best movie of the year so far no doubt, but I am excited to see where it ends up after some age!</p>
