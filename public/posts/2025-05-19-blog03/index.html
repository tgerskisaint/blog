<p>I&rsquo;ve replaced vs code with emacs for the time being. Doom emacs, but emcas nonetheless. I think it&rsquo;s been a little over a year since i&rsquo;ve been on social
medi. Making a linkedin account the other day was pretty gross with the &ldquo;shorts&rdquo; and just general problemayic social media structure. I sure don&rsquo;t miss
Instagram. I guess I&rsquo;m still on socia media if you can&rsquo;t Youtube. I just don&rsquo;t think I can part with it—the knowledge on there is too substantial to
give up. Although I have drasticallly reduced Youtube usage on my phone and keep it mostly desktop these days. It helps that I have a FireFox plugin
that heavily mods Youtube for me. I&rsquo;m always in theater mode so the only thing I can see is the video unless i click out of theater mode. Even when I
do everythinhg is essentially black and only where my mouse hovers is lit up. Plus I&rsquo;ve disabled shorts from my homepage and search results. So
therefore, I&rsquo;m not inlcuding Youtube in the social media group, as long as I watch healthy content and not brain-rotting garbage. Youtube is the only
alphabet company product I&rsquo;m now using, and I think I acept the trade off of the heft of hoarding of my personal information in order to use Youtube,
quite possible the largest pool of human knowledge there is—or at least it&rsquo;s certainly the easiest to digest. So far, the Proton suite has been great
for me. I really don&rsquo;t have any gripes about their products worth mentioning. And, if anyone is queasy about the price for the premium subscriptuon
(which you really need), I&rsquo;d argue that it&rsquo;s much better, and morally sound, to pay for the product rather than to be the product.</p>
<pre><code> I'm currently enrolled in an online cyber security course and have just completed the network security module. This is probably my weakest area of
</code></pre>
<p>technology in general. The module helped but I still have a lot to learn. I just started Computer Networking: a Top DOwn Approach and i think it will
be an excellent resource to cover all my inefficines about the internet and Networks. Networking maxes out my current reading material, which includes
Python Crash Course and How COmputers Really Work. Both of those books are great, especially with the practical applicatipons and hands-on exercises
(the most important part in learning technology). I first tried reading Learning Python but found it too theoretical for the phase of learning I&rsquo;m
currently in. Still a great book, just have put it on the backburner for now while I mostly enagage with material that directly helps me complete the
projects I am working on.</p>
