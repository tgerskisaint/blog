# 01

## April 30, 2025

I'm an aggressively subpar writer, but they tell me the only way to improve that quality is to write more, and in the public eye as well, so I have some skin in the game. I guess that's valid advice; like a cornered weasel, I, too, can adapt and overcome when my back's against the wall. Of course, I'm cheating a bit by labeling this in the public eye, but hey! Maybe someday. Now that you know about my literary skills, I can tell you some other fascinating facts about me: I'm an entrepreneur (cringe), so yes, I am unemployed. I am proudly Ubuntu's newest member, which means I am now passionate about Open-Source software. I have been listening to the soundtrack of the film *Drive (2011)* for almost two weeks now; expect the occasional incoherent gem of a film review from me! I have to start exercising again because I'm spending a mortifying amount of time in my computer chair vibe-coding, and it's not even a Herman Miller. 

Oh yeah, that's right; I was supposed to be writing a 1-page mission statement for my new business idea, while I'm taking a break from my other startup, which has had me on the ropes all week, just mashing me with kidney shots. I will start strong again tomorrow, now that I have unlocked the blogger strength from deep within. You know what they say: the other startup idea always sounds better because it's painted pretty with hope, optimism, and the romancing of a new idea with new possibilities. While my current startup is drenched in gritty realism, pessimism, insane hours, and that nagging voice in the back of my mind telling me, "You're not him! You're not that guy." Yeah, I'm going to head out now, but before I go, let me leave you with this: drink water, read books, Future's 2019 EP *SAVE ME (2019)* is underrated in blasphemy proportions, and it will cure you of your woes. Likewise, Ryan Coogler's *Sinners (2025)* is a once-in-a-lifetime display of pure artistic genius: a film that transcends cinema and culture at large. And that's a wrap, folks. I bid you adieu (or however F.D.R. closed out his fireside chats).
