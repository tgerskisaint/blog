# 02 - The Creative Genius of Ryan Coogler

**Director:** Ryan Coogler
**Year:** 2025
**Watched on:** April 27, 2025
**Rating:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (out of 5)

Seeing Ryan Coogler's debut rated-R film, Sinners, isn't your regular movie theater viewing, it's a highly spiritual, awe-inspiring communal experience. I don't think I can recall the last time a film made me feel like this. Sinners reinforces the power of film and music, and their importance to our society.

The story centers on three characters—twin brothers Smoke and Stack, and their little cousin Sammy. Sammy is a sharecropper in the Mississippi Delta, the son a preacher, who longs for a life playing the blues out in the world, versus life as a field work in the Delta. His father doesn't condone this dream and dismisses the life of a musician as devil's work, warning Sammy, "You keep dancing with the devil... One day he's gonna follow you home." When cousins Smoke and Stack come back to town after being away in Chicago working for the Chicago Outfit led by notorious gangster, Al Capone, they quickly get started on their business idea of opening a juke joint back in their hometown. It's Sammy's lucky day as the cousins whisk him away into his dream gig—an opportunity to perform his blues at their cousin's juke joint. What ensures is a night of insanity, changing the fate of our character's forever.

It's astonishing how Coogler was able to blend culture and history, modern-day comedy, and classic horror tropes into a uniquely cohesive masterpiece! Even on the technical level, the detail and use of multi-formats of film was in itself, an artistic achievement.

The mood was menacing—a slow cook so you can really connect and get attached to the characters. Then boom—all hell breaks loose and unlike the majority of horror films, it actually cuts deep when characters start dying after you've spent so much time marinating with them. The score was fantastic obviously, we wouldn't expect anything else from the Academy Award winning composer, Ludwig Goransson, and the pipes on young Miles Caton! Performances were stellar across the board, and I have to give a major shout out to Delroy Lindo—he added so much humor, authenticity, and honesty to the film, even in his long competent career, this was one of his stand out performances. MBJ ate it up with the dual role. We are finally given film that showcases the true explosive talent of Michael B. Jordan. 

Also, I love the aspect of Smoke and Stack being veterans and going from the sharecropping Mississippi delta to seeing the other-side of he world as soldiers in WWI. Sinners evokes so much pride in black culture and history. Coogler was able to pack so much into this film—it truly has it all: blood, love, violence, family, sex, community, racism, religion, and vampires. The power of family and community is moving, the most talked about film scene this year—the dancing scene, transcended the film to instant classic status. This film is a pure triumph--best movie of the year so far no doubt, but I am excited to see where it ends up after some age!
